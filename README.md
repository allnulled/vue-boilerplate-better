# JSON Request Tester UI

Like Postman but you always do requests with the "Content-Type: application/json" set.

## Online demo

## Installation

Clone the project. The interesting directory is in `/docs`. The other things are to build it.

You can go to the online demo. But you will find limitations when you test your localhost URL. 

The optimum way to use this tool is to set the `docs` folder of the project into the `/jrtui` folder of the static server. This way, you don't have to build the project again.
